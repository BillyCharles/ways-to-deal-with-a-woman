(EAR PLUGS REQUIRED)Being the unwanted center of attention is not a fun experience, especially if you did something that makes you feel embarrassed. Even being around someone who is embarrassed can be uncomfortable. You may feel hot, sweaty, and like hiding or curling up into the fetal position. Luckily there are better ways to deal with embarrassment than that. Keep in mind that showing embarrassment after a transgression actually makes you look sincerely apologetic and trustworthy. So, amidst all the awkwardness, embarrassment isn't all bad but serves important social functions.[1][2] Apologize when appropriate. If you're embarrassed by something you did to someone else, say you're sorry and be genuine about it. That said, don't draw it out. Let her know you're truly sorry about what you did but don't perseverate on it.[3] For example, if you called her by the wrong name you might say something like: \"I'm really sorry about that, I've been really worried about Sarah lately; I guess she's just on my mind a lot right now.\"",
  "body": "> ****### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble# ### \r\n***\r\n with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n* **_`* `_**",
